# A Checkmk compatible CO2 traffic light

This small project aims to create a CO2 traffic lights based on ESP32.
The component choice was done in a way that it can be completely assembled on a 17x10 "third size" breadboard.
That design allows for easy translation to a 40x50mm² "perma proto" PCB board.

## Components used

It is inspired by Watterott CO2 Ampel, but uses different components:

* ESP32 of course as µC – ESP8266 might work (but requires changing I²C wiring)
* 128x32px² I²C SSD1306 OLED display 
* SGP30 TVOC eCO2 air quality sensor
* BME/BMP280 air pressure, temperature (and maybe humidity) sensor
* Two (or more WS2812B compatible design) LEDs

## Libraries used

GP30
