# Checkmk example agents for various microcontrollers

This repository contains various minimal [Checkmk](https://checkmk.com/) agents for IoT or microcontroller projects.
Besides teaching the Checkmk agent pull protocol, all the examples can be used as templates for sensor boards that can be directly integrated in the Checkmk monitoring.

The code here was started by me as a spare time project before being employed at [tribe29](https://tribe29.com).

A blog post in the Checkmk blog will follow soon. Stay tuned!
